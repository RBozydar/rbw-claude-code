# Narrative Analysis Workflow

For analyzing media narratives, sentiment patterns, and coverage disparities across different source countries and outlets.

<when_to_use>
- User asks about media coverage or framing of events
- Questions about bias or perspective differences between countries
- Tracking sentiment trends around topics, entities, or events
- Analysis of propaganda, information warfare, or narrative competition
- Keywords: "coverage", "narrative", "sentiment", "framing", "bias", "propaganda", "media", "perception"
</when_to_use>

<agents>
- **sentiment-tracker**: Monitors tone and sentiment patterns across sources
- **trend-analyst**: Analyzes coverage volume, evolution, and comparative patterns
</agents>

<data_sources>
- **gdelt_gkg**: Primary source for tone and theme analysis
  - Tone: Document-level sentiment scores
  - Themes: Topic categorization
  - Source metadata: Country, domain
  - Entities: Persons, organizations, locations mentioned
- **gdelt_trends**: Coverage evolution tracking
  - Volume trends over time
  - Theme emergence and decay
  - Geographic spread of coverage
</data_sources>

<research_phases>

## Phase 1: Coverage Baseline
Spawn sentiment-tracker to establish baseline:
```
Query gdelt_gkg for:
- Topic: [SUBJECT]
- Date range: [TIMEFRAME]
- Extract:
  - Article count by source country
  - Average tone by source country
  - Tone distribution (positive/neutral/negative)
  - Top themes co-occurring with topic
```

## Phase 2: Sentiment Trend Analysis
Track sentiment evolution:
```
Query gdelt_gkg time series:
- Topic: [SUBJECT]
- Aggregate by: Day/Week
- Metrics:
  - Average tone
  - Tone variance
  - Volume
- Segment by: Source country/region

Identify:
- Sentiment inflection points
- Divergence between source countries
- Correlation with events
```

## Phase 3: Comparative Coverage Analysis
Spawn trend-analyst for cross-source comparison:
```
Compare coverage across source regions:
- Regions: [List - e.g., US, EU, Russia, China, Middle East]
- Metrics per region:
  - Volume (article count)
  - Tone (average, range)
  - Theme emphasis (which themes dominate)
  - Entity framing (how key actors are described)

Calculate:
- Coverage disparity index (volume differences)
- Sentiment gap (tone differences between regions)
- Frame divergence (theme emphasis differences)
```

## Phase 4: Narrative Mapping
Identify distinct narratives:
```
Cluster articles by:
- Dominant themes
- Tone profile
- Source region

For each cluster:
- Characterize narrative (1-2 sentences)
- Identify representative sources
- Map geographic distribution
- Track temporal evolution
```

## Phase 5: Event Correlation
Link narrative shifts to events:
```
Query gdelt_events for:
- Related events in timeframe
- Match to sentiment inflection points

For each inflection:
- Identify triggering event(s)
- Measure narrative impact (tone change magnitude)
- Track recovery/stabilization time
```

</research_phases>

<gap_detection>
Flag for additional research if:
- Source country coverage is highly imbalanced (>80% from one region)
- Tone scores show unusual uniformity (potential coordination)
- Key events show no corresponding sentiment shift (data gap)
- Narrative clusters overlap significantly (unclear framing distinctions)
- Major actor coverage is sparse (<20 articles for key entity)
- Time gaps in coverage >3 days for ongoing story
- Language/translation limitations affecting non-English sources
- Bot/automated content patterns detected
</gap_detection>
