# Conflict Analysis Workflow

For analyzing armed conflicts, security situations, and inter-state tensions using GDELT event data.

<when_to_use>
- User asks about ongoing conflicts, wars, or military operations
- Questions about tensions between specific countries or actors
- Requests to track escalation or de-escalation patterns
- Analysis of belligerents, allies, or mediators in a conflict
- Keywords: "conflict", "war", "military", "escalation", "ceasefire", "troops", "attack"
</when_to_use>

<agents>
- **conflict-analyst**: Primary analyst for conflict event interpretation
- **actor-mapper**: Maps relationships between conflict actors (belligerents, allies, mediators, proxies)
</agents>

<data_sources>
- **gdelt_events**: Primary source for conflict events
  - CAMEO codes 14-20 (protest, force, coercion, assault, fight, mass violence, unconventional mass violence)
  - Goldstein scale for intensity measurement (-10 to +10)
  - Actor1/Actor2 for participant identification
- **gdelt_gkg**: Supplementary themes and entity extraction
  - Themes: CONFLICT, MILITARY, TERROR, REBELLION
  - Persons/Organizations involved
</data_sources>

<research_phases>

## Phase 1: Event Collection
Spawn conflict-analyst to query gdelt_events:
```
Query gdelt_events for:
- Geographic focus: [REGION/COUNTRY]
- Date range: [TIMEFRAME]
- CAMEO root codes: 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20
- Return: EventCode, Actor1Name, Actor2Name, GoldsteinScale, NumMentions, SourceURL
- Sort by: NumMentions DESC, GoldsteinScale ASC
```

## Phase 2: Actor Mapping
Spawn actor-mapper to analyze relationships:
```
From Phase 1 events, extract:
- Primary belligerents (most frequent Actor1/Actor2 pairs in hostile events)
- Allies (actors appearing together against common opponent)
- Mediators (actors appearing in CAMEO 04-06 events with belligerents)
- Proxies (non-state actors affiliated with state actors)

Build relationship graph with:
- Edge type: hostile/allied/neutral/mediating
- Edge weight: event frequency
```

## Phase 3: Escalation Analysis
Analyze Goldstein scale trends:
```
For each week/day in timeframe:
- Calculate average Goldstein score
- Count events by intensity tier:
  - Verbal hostility: -5 to -1
  - Material conflict: -7 to -5
  - High intensity: -10 to -7
- Identify inflection points (>20% change in weekly average)
```

## Phase 4: Narrative Context
Query gdelt_gkg for context:
```
Extract for key actors and events:
- Themes associated with conflict
- Tone analysis of coverage
- Geographic spread of reporting
```

</research_phases>

<gap_detection>
Flag for additional research if:
- Actor relationships are ambiguous (appears in both hostile and allied events)
- Goldstein trend shows sudden reversals without explanation
- Key actors appear with <10 events (insufficient data)
- Mediator activity detected but ceasefire negotiations not covered
- Proxy relationships implied but not confirmed by event patterns
- Time gaps >7 days in event coverage for active conflict
</gap_detection>

## Event Breakdown

### By Category (CAMEO)
